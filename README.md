# 🚀 Typeracer Automation Script

This repository houses a Python script designed to automate typing on [Typeracer](https://play.typeracer.com/), a popular online typing competition platform. The script utilizes a combination of Selenium WebDriver for web automation, PyAutoGUI for controlling the keyboard and mouse, EasyOCR for optical character recognition, and OpenCV for image processing. 🤖

## 🧰 Features

- **Web Automation**: Utilizes Selenium WebDriver to navigate and interact with the Typeracer web application.
- **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**: Leverages EasyOCR to read and interpret the text that needs to be typed.
- **Image Processing**: Employs OpenCV for capturing and processing screenshots of the text.
- **Keyboard Simulation**: Uses PyAutoGUI to simulate keyboard typing based on the recognized text.
